# Spam Email Classification System

This project is a Machine Learning based **Spam Email Classification System** developed using **Python**, **Flask**, and **Scikit-learn**.  
It predicts whether a given email or message is **Spam** or **Not Spam**.

---

## 🔹 Project Description

Spam emails are unwanted messages that usually contain advertisements, fake offers, or phishing attempts.  
This project uses Machine Learning techniques to automatically detect spam emails based on their content.

The model is trained using the **SMS Spam Collection Dataset** and deployed as a web application using Flask.

---

## 🔹 Features

- Classifies messages as **Spam** or **Not Spam**
- Uses **TF-IDF Vectorization**
- Uses **Logistic Regression** for classification
- Web-based interface using Flask
- Simple and beginner-friendly implementation

---

## 🔹 Technologies Used

- Python  
- Flask  
- Scikit-learn  
- Pandas  
- HTML, CSS  
- Git & GitHub
